# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Twitter

This project reports on the design of sentiment analysis, extracting a vast number of tweets.  
It addresses the problem of sentiment analysis in twitter; that is classifying tweets according to the sentiment expressed in them: positive, negative, or neutral. We hope to achieve a reflection of public opinion by analysing the sentiments expressed in the tweets. Analysing the general view is essential for many applications, including firms trying to find out the response of their products in the market, predicting political elections, and predicting socioeconomic phenomena like the stock exchange. This project aims to develop a functional classifier for accurate and automatic sentiment classification of an unknown tweet stream
